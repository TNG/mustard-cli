# Contributing

Contributions are very welcome. The following will provide some helpful guidelines.

## How to contribute

If you want to submit a contribution, please follow the following workflow:

* Fork the project

* Add your contribution
* When you're completely done, build the project and run all tests
* Create a Pull Request

## What to contribute
* The known issues in the README.md is a good start
* If you want to contribute larger features, such as using an alternative source code management server other than bitbucket, 
it might be useful to contact us prior to implementation
